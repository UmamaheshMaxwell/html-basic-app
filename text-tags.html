            Lorem &nbsp; Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
             ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
             type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
